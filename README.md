# Expense Tracker

Expense Tracker is an application that allows you to keep track of shared expenses to easily split bills with friends and family.

It is mostly an experiment for my personal use and also to discover new tools/frameworks. Frontend is built thanks to the awesome [Quasar framework](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar) and backend is powered by Go backed with a PostgreSQL database.

If you want to give it a try, you can install it for free.
