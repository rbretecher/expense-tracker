# Expense Tracker

Expense Tracker is an application that allows you to keep track of shared expenses to easily split bills with friends and family.

It is mostly an experiment for my personal use and also to discover new tools/frameworks. Frontend is built thanks to the awesome [Quasar framework](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar) and backend is powered by Go backed with a PostgreSQL database.

## How to use

### Start locally

You must have Docker and Docker Compose installed.

Clone the repository and execute :

```bash
make start
```

The project will be available at : http://localhost:8080
